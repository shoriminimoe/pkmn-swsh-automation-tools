## Using ONE_CYCLE=140

It seems like the cycles can vary. For Wooloo, I tried 14, 15, and 16 and they
all appeared to stop in the same position. I believe this has something to do
with recompiling and flashing.

### Zigzagoon
- Bulbapedia says egg cycles is 15, datadex says 16
- Used EGG_CYCLE=16. This was probably more than enough.

### Ponyta
- Bulbapedia says egg cycles is 20, datadex says 21
- Used EGG_CYCLE=19. This was just about on the money. Maybe just a bit too
  much

### Wooloo
- Bulbapedia says egg cycles is 15, datadex says 16
